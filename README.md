This repository contains examples and experiments. The `visual-pcf` folder contains a sample PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) control capable of rendering multiple chart types.


Each dataset record must include a `label` field (string) and a `value` field (number). For example:

```json
[
  { "label": "Category A", "value": 10 },
  { "label": "Category B", "value": 25 }
]
```
